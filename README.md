# 🎓 Highlight Project: MicroLearn AI – AI-Powered Microlearning Platform

## 💡 Overview
MicroLearn AI is an innovative, **AI-driven microlearning platform** designed to engage students through continuous, short-duration interactions. The system dynamically generates quizzes, mini-tasks, summaries, and personalized feedback based on real-time user performance.

### **Core Problem Solved**
Unlike traditional LMS platforms, MicroLearn AI transforms the learning experience into continuous **micro-tasks**, significantly enhancing student motivation, knowledge retention, and learning outcomes by tailoring the pace to the individual.

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture & Stack

This project showcases expertise in building a modern, scalable **SaaS platform** integrating full-stack development with advanced AI services.

### **1. Core Platform Stack**

| Bileşen | Teknoloji | Fonksiyon |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend / API** | ![ASP.NET Core](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET_Core-512BD4?style=for-the-badge&logo=dot-net&logoColor=white) **ASP.NET Core 8 Web API** | Robust, scalable RESTful API for business logic. |
| **Frontend** | React + TailwindCSS / Blazor | Modern, responsive user interface. |
| **Database** | ![SQL Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL_Server-CC2927?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-sql-server&logoColor=white) / PostgreSQL | Reliable data persistence for user profiles and learning content. |
| **Authentication** | ASP.NET Identity + JWT | Secure user registration and session management. |

### **2. AI & Data Layer**

* **AI Engine:** Utilizes the **GPT-4/5 API** for dynamic, real-time generation of:
    * **Automated Quizzes & Summaries.**
    * **Personalized Feedback** based on incorrect answers.
* **Analytics:** Dedicated **Python** layer for processing learning data, generating performance analytics, and rendering visual reports (level graphs, progress reports).
* **Adaptation:** Core logic includes a **Student Profile** and **Difficulty Adaptation** module to adjust content based on the learner's individual success curve and pace.

### **3. Key Features (MVP)**

* **Adaptive Content:** Personalized content delivery based on individual learning speed and success.
* **Educator Module:** Tools for instructors to define courses, topics, goals, and access visual performance analytics.
* **Corporate Panel:** Multi-user and license management for scalable enterprise/institutional use (SaaS structure).
* **Automatic Content Generation:** Real-time quiz and summary creation via the GPT API.
